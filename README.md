## Context

This is the final project from a class at university about digital systems with microcontrollers. It was made by me and another student.

During the semester we learned how to implement concepts about digital systems using an arduino shield with ATMEGA328P microprocessor. Features such as serial interface communication, timers and interruptions generator were the main tools to enable us to communicate with the microprocessor, control the motors and also read data from a distance sensor.

## Project

These are the official [requirements.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrU5zzxb0RpPy4vOWS0bvIYJR3F_lWPB/view?usp=sharing)

I’ll briefly explain what we had to do and show some examples. 

Using the serial interface we had to:

- Control the car direction, i.e, forward, backward, right rotate and left rotate
- Ask for the last distance computed
- Change motors speed

Every functionality and all microprocessor's setup was implemented by us, we had to:
 - Setup the communication interface
 - Setup timers interrupt signal to generate a PWM pulse to control the motors speed
 - Define how and which message to send back
 - Compute the distance from an object to the sensor, using the microprocessor's operational frequency and the number of cycles between each signal generated by the sensor
 - Alternate LED's frequency depending on the object distance, high frequency for close distance and low frequency on other way
 - Stop the motors when the car is going forward and there's an object less than 10cm from it

If you’re a portuguese speaker the code has lots of comments explaining what each section does, for now I'll spare you from the underlying details and just skip to the final product.

This is the equipment that our teacher wanted us to use:

In consequence of the coronavirus pandemic we ended up using an online platform to simulate everything, the platform is called [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and it was extremely interesting developing with this tool!

Here is the digital version of the project using TinkerCad:

On [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) we were able to send commands and see responses through a monitor and also simulate an object in front of the sensor, being able to change its position and see the distance computed simultaneously.
